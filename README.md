Tensorflow Chatbot by Rishab Shama

Overview
============
This is the full code for  Amazing Tensorflow Chatbot  model to train a
chatbot on the [Cornell Movie Dialogue dataset](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). After training for a few hours, the bot is able to hold a fun conversation with the user.

* tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html)

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies


Usage
===========

To train the bot, edit the `seq2seq.ini` file so that mode is set to train like so :

`mode = train`

then run the code like so

``python execute.py``

To test the bot during or after training, edit the `seq2seq.ini` file so that mode is set to test like so :

`mode = test`

then run the code like so

``python execute.py``
